			<h1>About Ty Allen</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Hi, my name is Ty Allen. I'm from Ingersoll, ON, which is decent sized town, but I wouldn't blame you for not knowing it. I live here with my Mom and Dad, 3 sisters and 2 cats. I go to Fanshawe College and I am studying Interactive Media Design. I'm also pretty tall (193cm) which most people point out.</p>
		<p>I have a few hobbies, but I like to play video games the most. Currently, I have been playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Overwatch, Rivals of Aether and Xenoblade Chronicles. I enter tournaments for Smash bros, and Rivals which are both fighting games. I do pretty well in Smash tournaments, but I've only started entering tournaments for Rivals recently, so I'm not that great. Aside from gaming, I like to watch anime, read books and occasionally do art. I wish I was more into art, but it takes a lot of time which is taken up by school and my other hobbies.</p>
